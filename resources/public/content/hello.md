# WELCOME TO FUNCTIONAL SC
Functional Programming is style of crafting software that allows programmers to create simpler software for complex problems, saving you money and time.

We advocate for all functional programming technologies, in many standard programming languages or with one tailored for it such as:
Haskell, Clojure, F#, Erlang, OCaml, Scala and more.

Based in historic Charleston, South Carolina we are open to all to learn and explore technology.

| <font color="red" size="5em">&#9733;</font> **CORRECT** Powerful type systems shake out many problems before the program even runs.                                                       | <font color="red" size="5em">&#9733;</font> **CONCURRENT** Doing more than one thing at a time is easier with Functional Programming.<p> |
| <font color="red" size="5em">&#9733;</font> **EXPRESSIVE** Abstract away boilerplate commonly found in popluar programming languages.                                                     | <font color="red" size="5em">&#9733;</font> **DECLARATIVE** Why tell the computer how to do something when you can just tell it what you want?<p> |
| <font color="red" size="5em">&#9733;</font> **NO SIDE EFFECTS** The metaphorical rug isn't pulled from under your feet with small, reusable functions that don't tarnish the environment. | <font color="red" size="5em">&#9733;</font> **TESTABLE** This highly abstract environment leads to automated testing. |

# Join Us #

Our first meeting since the pandemic! A nice face to face will help with those pandemic-blues where we discuss the state of the Functional Programming world and more!
